    I was introduced to computers by
    <span class="text-cat-red">my father</span>, who used to have a company
    where he developed programs and sold computers. When I turned around seven
    years old, he introduced me to
    <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_(programming_language)">
      Clipper
    </A>.
  </p>
  <p>
    During my years in
    <span class="text-cat-red">mechanical engineering ⚙️</span>, I learned some
    things about micro-controllers (Arduino), and enjoyed it so much I ended
    doing my grade project in
    <span class="text-cat-red">Smart Factories 🏭 and Industry 4.0</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the search of knowledge, I started my
    <span class="text-cat-red">masters degree 👨🏻‍🎓</span> and learned a variety of
    technologies that paved my way into
    <span class="text-cat-red">web development 🌐</span>. While I currently
    perform as a Frontend Developer, I'm interested in all aspects of web
    development, as backend and infrastructure, plus
    <span class="text-cat-red">micro-controllers and smart homes</span>.
