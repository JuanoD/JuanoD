<Section name="About Me" animation={1} class="max-w-prose *:text-pretty *:mb-4">
  <p>
    I was introduced to computers by <span class="text-cat-red">my father</span
    >, who used to have a company where he developed programs and sold
    computers. When I turned around seven years old, he introduced me to
    <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_(programming_language)">
      Clipper
    </A>.
  </p>
  <p>
    During my years in <span class="text-cat-red">mechanical engineering</span>,
    I learned some things about micro-controllers (Arduino), and enjoyed it so
    much I ended doing my grade project in <span class="text-cat-red"
      >Smart Factories and Industry 4.0</span
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the search of knowledge, I started my <span class="text-cat-red"
      >masters degree</span
    > and learned a variety of technologies that paved my way into <span
      class="text-cat-red">web development</span
    >. While I currently perform as a Frontend Developer, I'm interested in all
    aspects of web development, plus <span class="text-cat-red"
      >micro-controllers and smart homes</span
    >.
